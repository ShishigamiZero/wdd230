                        <p>The Halo/Rockstar Energy Mobile Page is a good example of Visual Hierarchy because it draws the viewer's attention to the things that are most important. As a gamer viewing the site, their attention is immediately drawn to the word "SCORE" because of the large font. The sizing of the other words and lines also aims to get the readers attention, and explain the promotion, where codes from energy drinks can be exchanged for in-game content for the new Halo game. </p>

                        <p>The Grainger Mobile site is a good example of contrast. The colors were chosen to make the page readable, and it does do in a very straight forward matter. This site is for all kinds of hardware and accesories that someone in construction or other areas might need to get their work done. The simple two column category layout makes navigating the site simple for what you need. </p>

                    <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
                        <h4>Amazon</h4>
                        <p><a href="www.amazon.com" target="_blank">www.amazon.com</a></p>
                        <img class="mobileimg" src="../images/amazonmobile.jpg" alt="Screenshot of Amazon Mobile Site" />
                        <p>I personally felt that Amazon's mobile website is an example of Hick's law, or rather, why you want to avoid this kind of web design. There is a lot going on here, there are many categories, and too many sections if you kept scrolling down the page. Amazon only gets away with this, because most people will immediately use the search bar instaed of browsing the page when shopping here. Compared to the Grainger webpage, Amazon's page has too much going on for it's own good. If I only came to the page to browse and didn't know about the search bar, I wouldn't know where to start. Hick's law is the idea that presenting too many ideas to someone is bad because it will take them longer to make a decision. If you go to the Amazon mobile page and spend some time scrolling through it, you will see why this is an example of how you should not design a mobile page.  </p>
